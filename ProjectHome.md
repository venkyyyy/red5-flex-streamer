This project was meant to be a simple video tool which works on opensource technologies and allows the developers and webmasters to provide the Live Video streaming to the clients at low/no cost

**What this project is about:**

This video tool can be embedded to any website easily. You can either run a simple webcam streaming page which broadcast's your webcam on your website.

Or you could run a big video sharing website or a social network which allows the users to record their webcams and other devices to share with the other people

This video red5 recorder and streamer can help you .

This tool allows the user to pick his own thumbnail at any frame on the video .


**What this project is not about:**

A complete video solution.. which means there is no security features , user signup , authentication ,etc .. This tool is a starting point..

The project source is a great collection for those who build the functions like the thumbnail-er , Video capturing and the video streaming  and Flex phpamf gateways and so on.
